# hyperframes-trailer-demo

A 103.6-second, 1920×1080 beat-synced product trailer built with [HyperFrames](https://hyperframes.heygen.com). Seven scenes choreographed to an action-trailer rock soundtrack — intro, title drop, three feature scenes, pricing, outro. Every scale pulse, flash, shake, and color burst lands on a beat extracted by `librosa`.

This is a sample / reference project. The product is fictional.

## Get the music

The composition expects a file named `soundtrack.mp3` at the project root. It is **not** included in this repo (Pixabay's license discourages redistributing tracks as standalone files).

Download it yourself — it's free:

1. Track: **"Action trailer promo rock"** by **MagpieMusic** on Pixabay
2. Search Pixabay music: <https://pixabay.com/music/search/action%20trailer%20promo%20rock/> — the MagpieMusic track (ID **513687**, 1:43)
3. Save the file as `soundtrack.mp3` in this project root.

If you swap in a different soundtrack, re-run the beat analysis (see below) and adjust scene boundaries in `index.html` to match the new `segment_boundaries`.

## Run it

```bash
npm run dev       # Studio preview at http://localhost:3002/#project/product-test
npm run check     # lint + validate + inspect
npm run render    # render to MP4 (writes to renders/)
```

The Studio hot-reloads when you edit `index.html`.

## Beat analysis pipeline

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install librosa
.venv/bin/python scripts/analyze.py soundtrack.mp3 > analysis.json
```

`analysis.json` contains: tempo (161.5 BPM for the default track), beat times, beat energies, onset times, and `segment_boundaries` from agglomerative chroma segmentation — the seven scene boundaries (0, 6.4, 16.7, 36.9, 59.1, 72.2, 97.7) come straight from this file.

## Project layout

```
index.html         single-file composition (all 7 scenes, ~500 lines)
soundtrack.mp3     (not committed — see "Get the music")
analysis.json      librosa beat analysis output
scripts/analyze.py librosa wrapper that produces analysis.json
CLAUDE.md          AI agent guidance (architecture, conventions, gotchas)
hyperframes.json   HyperFrames project config
meta.json          project metadata
```
