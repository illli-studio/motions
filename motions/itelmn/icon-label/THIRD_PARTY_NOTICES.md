# BatchClip third-party notices and redistribution audit

**Audit date:** 20 July 2026
**Release status:** **CLEARED for the Windows x64 payload described below.**

This file is part of every BatchClip release payload. It records the redistribution review of bundled fonts, audio, icons, and compiled third-party code selected by `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. It is not legal advice and does not replace the license terms below or the original license files retained in packaged npm modules.

The release gate is `npm run audit:third-party -- --release`. It verifies the audited asset hashes and package versions before either platform release script can package the application.

## Cleared Windows x64 release payload

The previously blocked material was removed instead of waived:

- Removed `ffmpeg-static` and `@ffprobe-installer` plus their platform binaries.
- Removed Remotion and its compositor/media packages. The inactive Remotion-only render features remain unregistered and their source is excluded from packaged files.
- Removed HyperFrames, which also removed transitive sharp/libvips and ONNX Runtime binaries. HyperFrames overlays are no longer registered in the release render pipeline.
- Removed the three unproven renderer UI sounds.
- Removed the unlicensed Media Master logo.

Windows now bundles a matching `ffmpeg.exe` / `ffprobe.exe` pair from BtbN FFmpeg-Builds release `latest`, commit `8c736b2d6fe5da2a10a8896d01e53bfb0ca4f665`, published 20 July 2026. The asset was `ffmpeg-n8.1-latest-win64-gpl-8.1.zip`, upstream SHA-256 `bffb1e3fbff5bba5ab2c54d36cc5935b1f0dd5219fb9eec8388df6bd5d95c933`. The binaries report FFmpeg 8.1 with `--enable-gpl --enable-version3`, explicitly `--disable-libfdk-aac`, and no `--enable-nonfree`.

### Project-owned procedural SFX — cleared

Repository commit `4787c756b62c646da2792d2bcfd6660e0657a27d` records these six files and their README as original FFmpeg synthesis from sine/noise/filter generators. BatchClip contributors release these project-owned recordings for unrestricted redistribution with BatchClip (CC0-equivalent waiver; attribution is not required).

### Music — empty

No music recording is currently present under `resources/music/`; only `resources/music/README.md` exists. Adding any audio file changes the audited file set and blocks the release gate until its grant and hash are recorded.

## Audited icon and artwork assets

### BatchClip release artwork — cleared

The BatchClip artwork is project-owned and covered by the repository MIT license. The raster/installer family is reproducibly generated by `scripts/generate-release-art.py` from product color tokens and the bundled Inter fonts. `build/icon.svg` is the project-authored editable vector source. These are not third-party assets.

### Third-party icon content

- `lucide-react@0.475.0` supplies icons embedded in renderer JavaScript under the ISC license. Copyright for Feather portions © 2013–2022 Cole Bemis; other Lucide portions © 2022 Lucide Contributors. Its original license remains at `node_modules/lucide-react/LICENSE` and is reproduced below.
- Inline SVG shapes authored directly in project source are covered by the BatchClip MIT license; no external SVG files were found beyond the audited build artwork.

## Audited compiled third-party code

Exact versions come from `package-lock.json`, not semver ranges in `package.json`.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Electron runtime, including Chromium/Node.js | Electron `34.5.8` | MIT plus Electron's bundled Chromium notices | Permission established; preserve Electron `LICENSE` and `LICENSES.chromium.html` in the release |
| better-sqlite3 native addon + SQLite amalgamation | `better-sqlite3@12.9.0` | MIT; SQLite public domain | Cleared; original `node_modules/better-sqlite3/LICENSE` remains packaged |

The production tree also contains executable JavaScript command shims. Those are source-form scripts covered by their npm packages' licenses, not compiled binary payloads. Electron-builder/NSIS build-time executables are not installed as standalone application resources; the generated installer must continue to retain any notices electron-builder places in the artifact.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
