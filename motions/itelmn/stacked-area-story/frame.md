## Frame

A wide, cinematic stacked-area field fills the canvas beneath a concise headline. Four categorical bands create one flowing silhouette; a right-side mix rail reports the values at the live edge. The chart remains the hero rather than being placed inside a dashboard card.

## Data modes

- `absolute` scales the vertical domain to the largest total and reports source values.
- `percent` normalizes every date to 100% and reports each series' live share.
- Both modes use the same long-form `date / series / value` input and preserve series order.

## Motion

- Begin closed, open with a soft split shutter, then stage the headline, plot, and mix rail together.
- Reveal the complete precomputed area geometry with a left-to-right SVG clip so early data never stretches to the far edge.
- Keep the endpoint, date chip, values, and band labels derived from one normalized timeline progress value.
- Resolve into a final composition summary, hold, then close with the matching shutter.
- Never use wall-clock animation, requestAnimationFrame, random values, or library autoplay.
